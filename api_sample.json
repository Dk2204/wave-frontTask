What was once framed as an internal efficiency challenge for cloud providers has become a visible pressure on national energy systems, local communities (particularly in resource-stressed regions), and enterprise sustainability strategies.</p> \n<p>This is not a theoretical debate. Across the UK and other mature markets, AI datacentres are being fast-tracked through planning systems, prioritised for grid connections, and framed as strategic national assets.</p> \n<p>At the same time, governments are relying heavily on AI-enabled productivity gains to deliver economic and public-sector reform, <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/ukhotviews-extra/archive/2025/09/17/the-31bn-question-is-britain-ready-for-its-ai-infrastructure-boom\">often without fully accounting for the infrastructure and energy trade-offs involved</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366637333/Microsoft-urges-tech-rivals-to-cover-datacentre-expansion-related-power-costs-to-protect-consumers\">Microsoft\u2019s recent call for a \u201ccommunity-first\u201d approach to AI infrastructure</a> is therefore timely. It reflects burgeoning awareness amongst the hyperscalers that AI growth risks eroding public trust if they fail to address the technology\u2019s energy and environmental impacts.</p> \n<p>But it also exposes a deeper issue: if AI infrastructure is now treated as strategic national capability \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2025/07/22/sustainability-technology-activity-index-2025-global-market-shaping-trends\">subject to the same scrutiny as other forms of critical infrastructure</a> \u2013 then responsibility for its impacts can no longer sit with suppliers alone, nor be absorbed by the wider energy sector without debate.</p> \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"The real cost of AI infrastructure is no longer hidden\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>The real cost of AI infrastructure is no longer hidden<b> </b></h2>\n <p>For much of the past decade, cloud economics allowed energy consumption to be abstracted away from enterprise decision-making. Hyperscalers invested at scale, efficiencies improved, and sustainability narratives focused on relative gains versus on-premise infrastructure.</p>\n <p>AI changes that equation, because its workloads change the scale, timing, and concentration of energy demand. Unlike earlier waves of cloud adoption, AI infrastructure drives sustained high-intensity compute, exacerbates peak demand pressures, and accelerates the need for grid reinforcement and transmission upgrades.</p>\n <p>This is already visible in the prioritisation of <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366628066/The-UK-governments-AI-Growth-Zones-strategy-Everything-you-need-to-know\">AI Growth Zones</a> and datacentres for grid access <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2026/02/05/accelerating-the-adoption-of-deep-and-emerging-tech-in-uk-energy\">(at a time when local electricity systems may already be under strain)</a>. Public investment in energy infrastructure has always underpinned economic development, and AI datacentres are increasingly framed as critical national infrastructure. However, once AI infrastructure becomes visible at this level, the question of who pays becomes unavoidable\u2026 and simply treating AI growth as a public good does not absolve private actors of responsibility.</p>\n <p>Hyperscalers do invest heavily in renewable energy procurement and efficiency (for instance, <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2025/09/17/sustainability-technology-activity-index-2025-global-supplier-prospects\">AWS\u2019s early achievement of renewable electricity matching targets and Microsoft\u2019s investments in carbon removal and water stewardship</a>). Yet corporate-level commitments do not automatically extend to local grid upgrades, peak-load balancing, or network resilience costs; and the reporting of global averages can be used to hide local policy discrepancies.</p>\n <p>Credibility in climate and energy policy now depends less on ambition and more on implementation. Shifting costs off balance sheets does not make them disappear; it simply obscures who bears them.</p>\n <p>This challenge is intensified by diverging national policy regimes as well. In the US, AI infrastructure is now explicitly framed as a national security and economic priority, with environmental and planning constraints treated as barriers to acceleration. In the UK and Europe, however, AI growth is being layered onto energy systems already constrained by decarbonisation targets and public accountability.</p>\n <p>US-headquartered hyperscalers therefore operate across fundamentally different policy environments, with sustainability commitments that must travel across borders even when their home markets do not enforce equivalent constraints (a divergence that matters for UK suppliers, integrators, and enterprise buyers operating across global AI supply chains).</p>\n</section>        \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Environmental responsibility cannot be outsourced to hyperscalers alone\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>Environmental responsibility cannot be outsourced to hyperscalers alone</h2>\n <p>Decisions about model size, training frequency, workload placement, and operating schedules all materially affect energy consumption, and hyperscalers have responded with efficiency gains, renewable energy procurement, and public commitments to net-zero operations.</p>\n <p>However, focusing responsibility solely on big tech firms risks missing a deeper structural issue: whilst AI infrastructure is built by hyperscalers, its ultimate shape is determined by how enterprises choose to use it.</p>\n <p>Many organisations still treat AI as an abstract capability layered onto existing cloud contracts, rather than as a new class of infrastructure (one with distinct sustainability implications that encompass water usage and land constraints as well as energy supply). Some AI workloads are latency-sensitive and energy-intensive; others are batch-based and far more flexible. Some require GPUs running at full capacity; many do not. &nbsp;</p>\n <p>Decisions made by enterprise IT leaders about architecture, deployment models, and operating patterns directly influence energy consumption and environmental impact. Treating these dynamics as someone else\u2019s problem is no longer tenable. In practice, this means that environmental responsibility must be shared across infrastructure providers, policymakers, and enterprise users.</p>\n <p>The environmental implications are even more pressing when the AI application in question is itself designed to <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2024/11/08/managing-the-sustainable-ai-paradox\">enable system optimisation and energy efficiency</a>, as there must be a provable environmental net benefit to choosing a particular sustainability tech solution.</p>\n</section>      \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Governance, not goodwill\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>Governance, not goodwill</h2>\n <p>If AI datacentre growth is to be supported through public-private cost-sharing (whether for grid reinforcement, planning acceleration, or clean power generation), it must be governed explicitly.</p>\n <p>Without transparency, cost-sharing risks becoming cost-shifting \u2013 particularly in energy systems already under pressure <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2026/02/05/accelerating-the-adoption-of-deep-and-emerging-tech-in-uk-energy\">(a risk amplified by the fragmented state of governance across the energy sector)</a>.</p>\n <p>The UK\u2019s evolving approach to social value in public procurement offers a useful parallel. Over time, social value has moved from aspiration to measurable expectation, with suppliers required to demonstrate additionality rather than rely on generic corporate commitments.</p>\n <p>Sustainability commitments for AI infrastructure will need to follow a similar trajectory to prevent tech firms from hiding behind general global statements that fail to make a dent at the local level, where the environmental impacts of AI growth are being felt.</p>\n <p>Microsoft\u2019s call to arms is notable not because it proposes a fully formed solution, but because it acknowledges that unmanaged AI infrastructure growth will create social backlash. From a policy perspective, this raises difficult trade-offs.</p>\n <p>Prioritising AI datacentres for grid connections may support economic growth (albeit with longer-term net effects as yet unproven), but it can also crowd out decarbonisation efforts. Funding grid reinforcement to support AI growth may be rational, but only if benefits are demonstrably shared rather than captured by the few.</p>\n <p>For enterprises, the implication is clear: energy responsibility will increasingly show up in procurement, regulation, and reporting expectations. Sustainability is no longer confined to corporate operations; it extends into the infrastructure choices embedded in digital transformation programmes.</p>\n</section>        \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"What enterprise IT leaders should be doing now\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>What enterprise IT leaders should be doing now</h2>\n <p>For CIOs and IT leaders, the question is not whether AI will increase energy and environmental pressure, but how to plan for it without undermining sustainability commitments. Three priorities stand out, all of which can be built into procurement criteria:</p>\n <ul class=\"default-list\"> \n  <li><b>Make AI workloads visible.</b> Many organisations lack granular insight into where AI workloads run, how energy-intensive they are, and how they interact with broader cloud consumption. Treating AI as \u201cjust another cloud service\u201d is no longer sufficient. Integrated climate intelligence platforms, rather than siloed reporting tools, are thus becoming essential.</li> \n  <li><b>Treat architecture as a sustainability decision. </b>Choices around model size, training frequency, deployment location, and workload scheduling all have energy implications. In some cases, shifting workloads away from peak demand periods or consolidating models can materially reduce environmental impact without sacrificing business value.</li> \n  <li><b>Change the supplier conversation. </b>Enterprise buyers should demand greater transparency from hyperscalers and integrators around energy use, grid impact, and environmental trade-offs. Corporate net zero commitments alone are no longer sufficient proxies for responsible AI delivery; what matters is how AI services are delivered in practice.</li> \n </ul>\n <p>These steps do not absolve hyperscalers of responsibility, but they recognise that enterprise demand is a powerful lever too.</p>\n</section>    \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"A more honest conversation about AI growth\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>A more honest conversation about AI growth</h2>\n <p>The global race to scale AI infrastructure is now being shaped by policy regimes willing to trade environmental constraint for speed and dominance. In the US, that trade-off is explicit; in the UK, although it\u2019s the government\u2019s mission to \u201dmake Britain a clean energy superpower\u201d, the environmental consequences of AI are arriving regardless. AI workloads run on physical infrastructure, draw power from real grids, and impose costs that someone must absorb. Unexamined assumptions about where environmental impacts land are no longer acceptable; but neither is treating them as a purely technical issue, framed as an ethical failure of Big Tech alone.</p>\n <p>The constraint here is not technological capability, but coordination and governance <a href=\"https://www.techmarketview.com/research/archive/2026/02/05/accelerating-the-adoption-of-deep-and-emerging-tech-in-uk-energy\">(the same structural barriers shaping the UK\u2019s clean energy transition more broadly)</a>. AI infrastructure is being layered onto a system already undergoing structural transformation, one in which further growth inevitably involves trade-offs.</p>\n <p>The uncomfortable reality is that AI growth creates costs that must be paid by someone. If those costs are hidden, deferred, or externalised, then trust in both technology and sustainability agendas will erode. If they are acknowledged, governed, and shared transparently, AI infrastructure can evolve in ways that support both long-term economic and environmental resilience.</p>\n <p>Microsoft\u2019s call for a community-first approach should therefore be read less as reassurance, and more as a warning. In a world where AI growth is being actively accelerated by geopolitics, sustainability will not be delivered by intent alone. It will depend on who is prepared to insist on accountability \u2013 in procurement, in architecture, and in policy.</p>\n <p>For enterprise IT leaders, this means moving beyond simplistic narratives and acknowledging that AI ambition and sustainability credibility are now inseparable. The technology may be central to future productivity and growth, but intelligence at scale is not free. The question is no longer whether we can afford to power AI responsibly\u2026 it is whether we can afford not to.</p>\n <div class=\"extra-info\">\n  <div class=\"extra-info-inner\">\n   <h3 class=\"splash-heading\">Read more from the IT Sustainability Think Tank</h3> \n   <ul class=\"default-list\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/IT-Sustainability-Think-Tank-AI-infrastructure-shared-responsibility-and-the-real-cost-of-progress\">When it comes to the environmental impacts of AI</a>, should big tech firms or enterprises, and their IT departments, be expected to \u201cdo their bit\u201d to limit the potential environmental fallout of the technology's growing usage?</li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/IT-Sustainability-Think-Tank-How-IT-sustainability-entered-the-mandate-era-during-2025\">A year is a long time in tech, and the same is true of IT sustainability</a>.

      "desc": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday pitched India as a central player in the global artificial intelligence ecosystem, saying the country aims to build technology at home while deploying it worldwide. \u201cDesign and develop in India. Deliver to the world. Deliver to humanity,\u201d Modi told a gathering of some world leaders, technology executives and policymakers at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. Modi\u2019s remarks came as India \u2014 one of the fastest-growing digital markets \u2014 seeks to leverage its experience in building large-scale digital public infrastructure and to present itself as a cost-effective hub for AI innovation. The summit was also addressed by French President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who called for a $3 billion fund to help poorer countries build basic AI capacity, including skills, data access and affordable computing power. \u201cThe future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries, or left to the whims of a few billionaires,\u201d Guterres said, stressing that AI must \u201cbelong to everyone.\u201d India aims to ramp up its AI scale India is using the summit to position itself as a bridge between advanced economies and the Global South. Indian officials cite the country\u2019s digital ID and online payments systems as a model for deploying AI at low cost, particularly in developing countries. \u201cWe must democratize AI. It must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment, particularly for the Global South,\u201d Modi said. With nearly 1 billion internet users, India has become a key market for global technology companies expanding their AI businesses. Last December, Microsoft announced a $17.5 billion investment over four years to expand cloud and AI infrastructure in India. It followed Google\u2019s $15 billion investment over five years, including plans for its first AI hub in the country. Amazon has also pledged $35 billion by 2030, targeting AI-driven digitization. India is also seeking up to $200 billion in data center investment in the coming years. The country, however, lags in developing its own large-scale AI model like U.S.-based OpenAI or China\u2019s DeepSeek, highlighting challenges such as limited access to advanced semiconductor chips, data centers and hundreds of local languages to learn from. The summit has faced troubles The summit opened Monday with organizational glitches, as attendees and exhibitors reported long lines and delays, and some complained on social media that personal belongings and display items had been stolen. Organizers later said the items were recovered. Problems resurfaced Wednesday when a private Indian university was expelled from the summit after a staff member showcased a commercially available Chinese-made robotic dog while claiming it as the institution\u2019s own innovation. The setbacks continued Thursday when Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates withdrew from a scheduled keynote address. No reason was given, though the Gates Foundation said the move was intended \u201cto ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit\u2019s key priorities.\u201d Gates is facing questions over his ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \u2014Associated Press",

      "desc": "<p>The amplification of disinformation about United Nations special rapporteur Francesca Albanese has prompted at least four European governments to call for her resignation over comments she never made.</p> \n<p>Responding to a deliberately truncated clip circulating online in which the special rapporteur for the human rights situation in Palestine ostensibly refers to Israel as \u201cthe common enemy of humanity\u201d, leading politicians and diplomatic figures from France, Germany, Italy and the US sharply condemned Albanese, with many calling for her immediate resignation.</p> \n<p>This includes German foreign minister Johann Wadephul, who <a href=\"https://x.com/AussenMinDE/status/2021970644582207724\">called</a> her position \u201cuntenable\u201d; French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who said France \u201cunreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks\u201d and called for her to step down; and Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani, who <a href=\"https://x.com/Antonio_Tajani/status/2022019909690028427\">said</a> that her \u201cbehaviours\u2026are not appropriate for the position she holds\u201d.</p> \n<p>Other figures who have amplified the disinformation include the Czech Republic\u2019s foreign minister Petr Macinka, who <a href=\"https://x.com/CzechMFA/status/2022212404705472685\">quoted Albanese on X</a> as having called Israel a \u201ccommon enemy of humanity\u201d and called for her resignation; and US ambassador Mike Waltz, who <a href=\"https://x.com/USAmbUN/status/2020613256566522095\">similarly quoted her saying the same</a> while accusing her of being an antisemite.</p> \n<p>Austrian foreign minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger went further, accusing Albanese of spreading hate speech and failing to meet the standards of impartiality expected of UN representatives.</p> \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Actual remarks\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>Actual remarks</h2>\n <p>While Albanese was critical of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza and the media reporting around it, in the remarks being referred to \u2013 made during a roundtable event in Doha organised by Al Jazeera, in which she spoke for roughly four minutes \u2013 the phrase is not directed at the state of Israel itself.</p>\n <p>\u201cThe fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support. This is a challenge. The fact that most of the media in the Western world has been amplifying the pro-apartheid genocidal narrative is a challenge,\u201d she said.</p>\n <p>\u201cAt the same time, here also lays the opportunity, because if international law has been stabbed in the heart, it\u2019s also true that never before has the global community seen the challenges we all face.</p>\n <p>\u201cWe who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy, and freedoms, the respect of fundamental freedoms is the last peaceful avenue, the last peaceful toolbox we have to regain our freedom.\u201d</p>\n <p>Multiple media outlets, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-voices-concern-over-criticism-expert-palestinian-rights-2026-02-13/#:~:text=A%20transcript%20of%20Albanese%27s%20remarks%20made%20in%20Doha%20on%20February%207%20seen%20by%20Reuters%20did%20not%20characterise%20Israel%20in%20this%20way%2C%20although%20she%20has%20consistently%20criticised%20the%20country%20in%20the%20past%20over%20the%20Gaza%20conflict\">Reuters</a> and <a href=\"https://embed.france24.com/en/video/1609AD55-D8E0-41FF-AB6B-8140DC225FE9\">France24</a>, as well as the UN Human Rights Office, have all confirmed that the video being referred to is doctored, and that while Albanese was critical of Israel, she never made the remarks being falsely attributed to her.</p>\n <p>During a press conference, Marta Hurtado, spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, for example, stated that Albanese \u201cdid not characterise any state as an enemy of humanity\u201d and invited \u201call to go see her remarks\u201d.</p>\n <p>Hurtado added Albanese was clearly referring to \u201cbroader systemic threats\u201d to human rights, and that her office is \u201cvery worried\u201d about escalating \u201cpersonal attacks, threats and disinformation\u201d targeting UN officials and independent experts.</p>\n <p>She further warned that such campaigns distract from \u201cserious human rights issues,\u201d including ongoing ceasefire violations being committed by the Israeli military on a daily basis.</p>\n <p>Despite being granted diplomatic immunity under her remit as a special rapporteur, Albanese was previously <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons\">sanctioned by the Trump administration in July 2025</a> \u2013 along with multiple members of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \u2013 after she sent \u201cthreatening letters\u201d to a number of multinational companies, including from the US, that warned of their complicity in gross violations of international law. The sanctions mean that Albanese is unable to access any banks accounts or assets based in the US, and is unable to travel to the country.</p>\n <p>Albanese herself has rejected the accusations made against her, and clarified on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/FranceskAlbs/status/2020983308818186721\">social media</a> that \u201cthe common enemy of humanity is the system that has enabled the genocide in Palestine, including the financial capital that funds it, the algorithms that obscure it and the weapons that enable it\u201d.</p>\n <p>She has also <a href=\"https://x.com/FranceskAlbs/status/2023366413570683310\">highlighted posts on X</a> that suggest the truncated clip was <a href=\"https://x.com/HillelNeuer/status/2020454512356376911\">initially shared online by Hillel Neuer, the executive director of UN Watch</a>, a pro-Israel non-governmental organisation that has <a href=\"https://unwatch.org/tag/francesca-albanese/\">repeatedly condemned Albanese since October 7</a> for being \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d.</p>\n <p>Commenting, Albanese said, \u201crepeating a lie until it\u2019s accepted \u2013 \u2018illusory truth effect\u2019\u2013 is a tactic long used by authoritarian regimes\u201d, and that \u201cA serious investigation is needed so the public sees what honest people have endured for decades\u201d.</p>\n <p>Computer Weekly contacted UN Watch about the source of the clip and Neuer\u2019s sharing of it, including whether he was aware it had been edited, but received no response.</p>\n <p>Reacting to the incident, Amnesty International secretary general Agn\u00e8s Callamard said in a statement that the ministers must fully retract their calls for Albanese\u2019s resignation. \u201cIt is reprehensible that ministers have attacked [Albanese] based on a deliberately truncated video to misrepresent and gravely misconstrue her messages \u2013 as is clear from watching her original address in its entirety,\u201d she said.</p>\n <p>\u201cThe ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media \u2013 as some have done. They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese\u2019s resignation. Their governments must also investigate how this disinformation happened with a view to preventing such situations.</p>\n <p>\u201cIf only these minsters had been as loud and forceful in confronting a state committing genocide, unlawful occupation and apartheid as they have in attacking a UN expert.\u201d</p>\n <p>The France-based Association of Jurists for the Respect of International Law (Jurdi), comprised of practising international lawyers, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/french-lawyers-seek-criminal-prosecution-foreign-minister-over-francesca-albanese-remarks\">said it has filed a criminal complaint against the French foreign minister Barrot</a>, claiming that his statements calling for Albanese\u2019s resignation \u201cmay amount to the criminal offence provided for under French law relating to the dissemination of false information\u201d.</p>\n <p>Computer Weekly contacted the office of every political figure that amplified the disinformation for comment, but only received a response from the German federal foreign office, which directed Computer Weekly to comments made during a government press conference on 13 February.</p>\n <p>\u201c[Minister Wadephul] was referring to the statement as a whole, not to a manipulated video or other circulating statements\u2026The point is that Ms. Albanese has repeatedly made statements and spread untenable falsehoods in the past, including about Germany,\u201d said the department\u2019s deputy spokesperson.</p>\n <p>\u201cThe German government has consistently rejected and criticised these statements. In connection with Israel, she spoke of a \u2018common enemy\u2019. Therefore, the entire context of the statement is what matters, regardless of how Ms. Albanese has subsequently explained it.\u201d</p>\n <p>The Austrian foreign minister has since deleted her post on X accusing Albanese of spreading hate speech.</p>\n</section>                      \n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"\u2018Economy of genocide\u2019\">\n <h2 class=\"section-title\"><i class=\"icon\" data-icon=\"1\"></i>\u2018Economy of genocide\u2019</h2>\n <p>As part of her mandate, Albanese has issued multiple reports since 7 October 2023 labelling Israel\u2019s war on Gaza as a genocide, and denouncing the global economic and political systems that have supported its war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n <p>In June 2025, for example, <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366626968/Tech-firms-complicit-in-economy-of-genocide-says-UN-rapporteur\">Albanese published an investigative report</a> detailing \u201cthe role of corporate entities in sustaining the illegal Israeli occupation and its ongoing genocidal campaign in Gaza\u201d.</p>\n <p>In particular, she highlighted how the \u201crepression of Palestinians has become progressively automated\u201d by the increasing supply of powerful military and surveillance technologies to Israel, including drones, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered targeting systems, cloud computing infrastructure, data analytics tools, biometric databases and high-tech weaponry.</p>\n <p>She said that if the companies supplying these technologies had conducted the proper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366621892/Tech-sector-still-failing-to-rid-supply-chains-of-forced-labour\">human rights due diligence</a>&nbsp;\u2013 including IBM, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366626673/Silicon-Valley-execs-sworn-in-to-US-Army-reserves-specialist-unit\">Palantir</a>&nbsp;\u2013 they would have divested \u201clong ago\u201d from involvement in Israel\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154496\">illegal occupation</a>&nbsp;of Gaza and the West Bank.</p>\n <p>\u201cAfter October 2023, long-standing systems of control, exploitation and dispossession metamorphosed into economic, technological and political infrastructures mobilised to inflict mass violence and immense destruction,\u201d she said.</p>\n <p>Under international law, Albanese pointed out the mere fact that due diligence has been conducted does not absolve companies from legal liability over their role in abuses. Instead, the liability of companies is determined by both their actions and the ultimate human rights impact.</p>\n <div class=\"extra-info\">\n  <div class=\"extra-info-inner\">\n   <h3 class=\"splash-heading\">Read more about mis- and disinformation</h3> \n   <ul class=\"default-list\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Misinformation-runs-deeper-than-social-media\">Misinformation runs deeper than social media</a>: While social media may contribute to the increasing rapid spread and reach of misinformation, the root causes of the problem go much deeper than the role of a particular company or way of using technology to communicate</li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366618096/Davos-2025-Misinformation-and-disinformation-are-most-pressing-risk-says-World-Economic-Forum\">Davos 2025: Misinformation and disinformation are most pressing risks, says World Economic Forum</a>: World leaders, business chiefs and civil society organisations will discuss the risks posed by misinformation, disinformation and artificial intelligence at the World Economic Forum</li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366626276/Traditional-fake-news-detection-fails-against-AI-generated-content\">Traditional fake news detection fails against AI-generated content</a>: As generative AI produces increasingly convincing text, Dutch researchers are exploring how linguistic cues, model bias and transparency tools can help detect fake news</li> \n   </ul>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</section>",

      "desc": "At the AI Impact Summit 2026, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, went beyond predicting the arrival of superintelligence. He framed the coming years as a defining test for democracy, governance, and global power. \u201cIf our predictions hold, by the end of 2028 more of the world\u2019s intellectual capacity could exist inside data centres than outside them,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe could be wrong, but it bears serious consideration.\u201d That projection anchored his central warning: the future of artificial intelligence will be shaped not just by capability, but by who controls it. India\u2019s Role in a Democratic AI Order Altman opened by pointing to India\u2019s rapid AI adoption. More than 100 million people in the country now use ChatGPT weekly, with students accounting for over a third of users. India has also become the fastest-growing market for Codex, OpenAI\u2019s coding agent. \u201cIt is striking how much progress India has made in its mission to put AI to work for more people,\u201d he said. He positioned India as uniquely placed to influence global AI norms. As the world\u2019s largest democracy, India has the opportunity to build AI at scale while shaping how it is governed. Advances in sovereign AI infrastructure and small language models, he argued, signal that India is actively shaping the technology rather than merely consuming it. Altman suggested that if intelligence increasingly resides in data centres, democratic countries like India will play a critical role in determining whether that power is distributed or centralised. Superintelligence, Democratisation and Safety Altman offered one of his strongest forecasts yet, suggesting that early forms of true superintelligence could emerge within two years. Such systems, he said, could outperform top executives and leading scientists. \u201cAt some point on its development curve, a superintelligence would be able to do a better job being the CEO of a major company than any executive; certainly me, or conduct better research than our best scientists.\u201d He traced the rapid acceleration of AI capabilities, from struggling with high-school mathematics to handling research-level problems in just a few years. While progress remains unpredictable, the pace suggests the next leap may arrive sooner than expected. Democratisation, Altman argued, is not just a moral choice but a safety strategy. Concentrating AI power within a single company or country increases systemic risk. \u201cDemocratisation of AI is the only fair and safe path forward,\u201d he said, rejecting the idea that society must trade freedom for breakthroughs. \u201cSome people want effective totalitarianism in exchange for a cure for cancer. I don\u2019t think we should accept that trade-off.\u201d He warned that safety cannot be solved inside AI labs alone. Risks range from misuse of powerful open-source biomodels to new forms of conflict enabled by AI. Addressing them will require governments, institutions, and civil society to work together. Economic Disruption and Long-Term Implications Altman acknowledged that rapid AI progress will reshape economies. As systems improve, the cost of many goods and services, from healthcare and education to manufacturing, could fall sharply. At the same time, labour disruption is inevitable. \u201cIt will be very hard to outwork a GPU in many ways,\u201d he said, while noting that humans retain advantages in empathy, judgement, and social connection. Placing disruption in historical context, Altman argued that each generation inherits a more powerful technological foundation. The responsibility today, he said, is to ensure that future generations benefit from AI\u2019s upside rather than bear the cost of concentrated power. He closed with a clear warning. The coming years will force a choice. \u201cAs this technology continues to improve rapidly, we can either empower people or concentrate power.\u201d Altman called for international coordination, potentially through institutions similar to the IAEA, to oversee advanced AI systems and respond quickly to emerging risks. If intelligence increasingly resides in data centres, the defining question will not be how smart machines become, but whether they expand human freedom or entrench centralised control. The technology is moving fast; the political and ethical decisions must keep pace.",

          "desc": "JioHotstar on Thursday announced a partnership with OpenAI to bring a ChatGPT-powered voice and text assistant to its streaming platform. The new feature will let viewers find shows and movies simply by speaking or typing what they feel like watching. Instead of scrolling endlessly or searching with keywords, users can describe their mood or situation and get personalised suggestions. The assistant will work in multiple Indian languages and understand natural, everyday conversation. The companies said the goal is to solve the common \u201cwhat should I watch\u201d problem by making discovery more intuitive. The feature will roll out in phases, starting with select live and on-demand content, and expand gradually. Uday Shankar, Vice Chairman of JioStar, said AI represents \u201ca transformative shift for the media and entertainment industry,\u201d adding that it disrupts the value chain \u201cfrom conceptualisation and production to discovery and monetisation.\u201d \u201cAs a tech-native, user-first platform, JioStar is embedding AI at the very core of the user experience,\u201d Shankar said. The OpenAI partnership, he added, will allow viewers to discover and curate content \u201csimply using their voice,\u201d calling it \u201ca fundamental reimagining of the entertainment experience.\u201d Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, said AI changes entertainment from a passive experience to a more interactive one. \u201cThrough our partnership with JioHotstar, we\u2019re bringing personalized AI directly into entertainment and live sports,\u201d she said, adding that users will be able to move \u201cfrom watching to asking\u201d in ways that feel natural and useful. The assistant will also work during live sports. Viewers can ask about key moments, scores or player highlights and get quick answers in a simple, conversational way. The partnership goes beyond the JioHotstar app. Users who ask ChatGPT for movie or show suggestions will also receive relevant recommendations and direct streaming links from JioHotstar\u2019s catalogue. This creates a two-way connection between the two platforms. The launch comes at a time when streaming services in India are competing to offer more personalised experiences. AI-powered recommendations are increasingly becoming a key way for platforms to stand out and keep viewers engaged.",

Two did not: rivals Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic. The two, who are locked in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s fiercest commercial rivalries, were standing side by side as the 13 corporate leaders joined Modi on stage, but they kept their raised fists conspicuously apart. Altman appeared visibly uncomfortable, looking away as the others, including Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai, went along with Modi\u2019s nudge and joined hands.

I wasn\u2019t sure what we were supposed to be doing,\u201d Altman later told news website Moneycontrol. OpenAI and Anthropic did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Bill Gates pulled out of India\u2019s summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing a blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational lapses, a robot row and complaints of traffic chaos. However, the summit has attracted more than $200 billion in investment pledges.
